 ## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3, Part 1

    I enjoyed this lab because it helped me test the waters more. It was nothing too difficult but since it was new stuff for me, it was still quite hard for me to do. But it was fun as well, I was learning how to do basic coding and using shell commands and getting use to the tools that I had at my disposal. 

* Lab 8, Part 2

    Now this lab was a lot more challenging for the simple fact that I still was not sure how to use loops at the time of the lab. I still am definitely not good at coding loops but I at least have somewhat of an idea but it's not easy, for me at least. But seeing the code and completing it was fun.

* Lab 11, Part 2

    Lab 11 was probably my favorite lab out of the 3 I have chosen. I just found it fun writing if statements. It was definitely new stuff for me and it was hard but when I was able to get the program running, it just felt so satisfying.
